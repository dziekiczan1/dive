## Introduction
This is a code repository for the **Where To? Dive!** project. 

Website made with MERN stack for all diving fans. Users can add or like a diving spot. I also created an admin panel.

Welcome to Where To? DIVE - a place where you can share and find the best diving spots from all over the world. Our website will help you find the best places in your area and more. Are you interested in wrecks, caves, or maybe beautiful coral reefs? You can find everything with us! Regardless of the level of your training. The website was created to share the best diving sites with people from all over the world. Are you planning a holiday trip? Or maybe a quick weekend trip out of town? See where it's best to dive. Maybe you accidentally discovered a great reservoir for diving yourself? Share this place with the rest of the people.

Stack used for this project: React, Redux, MongoDB, Express, Node.js
